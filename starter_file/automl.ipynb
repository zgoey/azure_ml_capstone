    "\n",
    "https://unpkg.com/color-name-list/dist/colornames.csv. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook runs code to label colors with one of the basic shades from the set {White, Black, Grey, Yellow, Red, Blue, Green, Brown, Pink, Orange, Purple} (see https://thelandofcolor.com/11-basic-color-names/). It does so by looking at the color name and taking the shade that occurs last in this string. So, for instance, the color 'Azure Green Blue' is assigned the label 'Blue'. Thus, a list of labeled RGB-values is built, where each RGB-triple is assigned to onw of the casic shade classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have uploaded the output of the notebook to:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/zgoey/azure_ml_capstone/blob/master/color_shades.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "and we will download it in raw form from this repo into our Azure workspace. It will then be used to train a ckassifier that can assign basic color shades to RGB-triplets. Such a classifier can then be used by color-blind people to detemine what color they are looking at. The end-application that we have in mind is something like http://www.hikarun.com/e/. This, however, is a progrtam that can only run under Windows. The advantage of having a web service doing the classification is that it can be accessed on a much wider range of devices."

To be sure that we do not run our experiment forever (thereby incurring unreasonable costs), we limit the time that the experiment will run to 1 hour. Finally, we set the maximum number of concurrent iterations to four, to make maximla usage of the concurrency capabilities of our compute."
